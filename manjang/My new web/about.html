   <h1>About Us</h1>
<div>
   <p id="usethisone">EatingWell has been publishing award-winning journalism about food, nutrition and sustainability for more than 30 years.
     Our mission is to share flavor-packed recipes from around the world, celebrating fresh ingredients and the farmers, 
     artisans and chefs who bring them to our table.
      Through science-backed wellness advice and smart stories about sustainability, 
     we help readers live their best lives. 
    We are about moderation and balance—not strict rules or fad diets—because for eating well to become a way of life, 
    it should be accessible, sustainable, inspiring and—above all—delicious.</p>

<div>
    <p>Our authoritative, science-based articles—such as What Should You Eat If You Come Down with Coronavirus? and 8 Ways to Follow the 
        Mediterranean Diet for Better Health—help our readers make better-informed food choices.
         We publish healthy recipes to make meals delicious, like Chicken Cutlets with Sun-Dried Tomato Cream Sauce and 
         Spinach & Mushroom Quiche, and healthy cooking how-to guides,
          such as The Ultimate Guide to Cooking Salmon and What Is a Sumo Orange and 
         How Do I Use It? Our easy-to-follow meal plans are designed by registered dietitians and food experts to help you lose weight, 
         manage diabetes, lower your cholesterol, get more fiber, go vegan, eat vegetarian and more. 
         We are based in Vermont—where EatingWell was originally founded in 1990—surrounded by a robust local, 
        sustainable food culture, farm-to-table restaurants and a renowned craft beer and cider scene.</p>
