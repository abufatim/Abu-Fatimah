    <h2>About cuisine</h2>


 <p>In the world of culinary arts, food is a true art form. In a sense, it's the ultimate artistic expression. 
    Every culture has their own unique style of cooking and ingredients that they use, 
    and every chef has their own unique style too.Though you won't find added sugars, processed foods and refined grains, 
    you will discover plenty of delicious and cozy comfort food dishes aimed to maximize nutrients without sacrificing flavor.
     Since being overweight can increase chronic inflammation, we set this plan at 1,500 calories per day, which is a level where most people will lose weight. 
    If you have other calorie needs, we also included modifications for 1,200 and 2,000 calories a day. </p>

    <p><h1>What is the Anti-Inflammatory Diet?</h1></p>

<p>The anti-inflammatory diet is a Mediterranean diet-esque style of eating that incorporates plenty of nutrient-rich fruits and veggies and healthy fats to help reduce chronic inflammation in our bodies. 
    It encourages an overall healthy eating pattern with a special focus on inflammation-busting foods, such as produce that is particularly high in nutrients, plus healthy fats, 
    including nuts and seeds, olives, salmon, tuna and other fatty fish. 
    To help lower chronic inflammation levels in the body, consider skipping or reducing your intake of added sugars and artificial sweeteners, refined grains and processed foods. In addition, 
    try cutting back on animal products, especially high-fat dairy and red meats in excess. 
    In addition to diet, lifestyle factors such as reducing stress, 
    improving sleep and getting physically active can all help reduce inflammation.</p>
