<p style="color:#ff0000 ;">A cuisine is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients, techniques and dishes, and 
    usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region. 
    Regional food preparation techniques, customs and ingredients often combine to create dishes unique to a region.[1]

    A cuisine is partly determined by ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Often particular
     regional varieties of ingredients are developed and contribute to the cuisine, 
    such as Japanese rice in Japanese cuisine and New Mexico chile in New Mexican cuisine.
    
    Religious food laws can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine, such as Hinduism in Indian cuisine, 
    Sikhism in Punjabi cuisine, Buddhism in East Asian cuisine, 
    Christianity in European cuisine,[2][3][4] Islam in Middle Eastern cuisine, and Judaism in </p>

<p>Cuisines evolve continually, and new cuisines are created by innovation and cultural interaction. One recent example is fusion cuisine, which combines elements of various culinary traditions while
     not being categorized per any one cuisine style, and generally refers to the innovations in many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s.[9]
     Nouvelle cuisine (New cuisine) is an approach to cooking and food presentation in French cuisine that was popularized in the
     1960s by the food critics Henri Gault, who invented the phrase, and his colleagues André Gayot and Christian Millau in a new restaurant guide, 
    the Gault-Millau, or Le Nouveau Guide.[citation needed] Molecular cuisine, is a modern style of 
    cooking which takes advantage of many technical innovations from the scientific disciplines (molecular cooking). The term was coined in 1999 by the French INRA chemist Hervé This because he wanted to distinguish it from the name 
    Molecular gastronomy (a scientific activity) that was introduced by him and the late Oxford physicist Nicholas Kurti in 1988.[10] It is also named as multi sensory cooking, modernist cuisine, culinary physics, and experimental cuisine by some chefs.[11] Besides, 
    international trade brings new foodstuffs including ingredients to existing cuisines and leads to changes. The introduction of hot pepper to 
    China from South America around the end of the 17th century, greatly influencing Sichuan cuisine,
     which combines the original taste (with use of Sichuan pepper) with the taste of newly introduced hot pepper and creates a unique mala (麻辣) flavor that's
     mouth-numbingly spicy and pungent.[12]</p>
