        <p>Welcome to <br> The Foodie Chef <br> Resturant</p>
        <h5>Eat Smart, Live Healthy</h5>
        <h6>A collection of incredibly tasty, savory entrees. 
            Lots of chicken recipes, 
            beef recipes and seafood recipes, plenty of soups, 
            some delicious healthy options. <br><br>
            Our mission is to share flavor-packed recipes from around the world, 
            celebrating fresh ingredients and the farmers, 
            artisans and chefs who bring them to our table. <br><br>
            We are about moderation and balance not strict rules or fad diets because for eating well to 
            become a way of life, it should be accessible, sustainable, inspiring and above all delicious. <br><br>
            It is important that we enjoy our food, and it is good to eat a variety of different foods, rather than the same
            foods all the time. It is not only more interesting, it also means we are more likely to get the many different 
            vitamins and minerals that different foods provide us with. <br><br>
            No individual's  food is 'good' or 'bad', it is the overall balance of foods over a period of timethat matters.
            Some knowledge and understanding of what a healthy diet is helps us to make sensible choices from the huge 
            variety of foods that are available.
